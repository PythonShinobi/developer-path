            Salaries

            style={{ textAlign: 'justify', lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}
          >
            Salaries for DevOps engineers can vary significantly based on several key factors, including experience, location, company size, and industry. Here’s how these factors contribute to salary differences:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>1. Experience:</strong> Experience is a major determinant of salary. Entry-level engineers, those with less than a year of experience, generally earn lower salaries as they are still gaining practical skills and understanding of the development process. As engineers gain experience, their salaries tend to rise because of their increased ability to handle complex projects and contribute more effectively to operations and development teams.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2. Location:</strong> Geographic location has a significant impact on salary levels. Engineers working in tech-centric cities like San Francisco, New York, or Seattle typically earn higher salaries compared to those in less tech-focused areas. This discrepancy is often due to the higher cost of living in major tech hubs and the competitive job market within these regions.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3. Company Size and Industry:</strong> The size of the employer and the industry in which the company operates also affect salary ranges. Larger companies, particularly those in the tech industry, may offer higher salaries and more extensive benefits packages compared to smaller firms or companies in less competitive sectors. Additionally, industries with high demand for tech talent, such as fintech or health tech, might offer more competitive compensation.
            <br /><br />
            Here’s a breakdown of typical salary ranges for DevOps engineers based on years of experience:
