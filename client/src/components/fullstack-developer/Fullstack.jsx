          >
            Salaries for Fullstack developers can vary significantly based on several key factors, including experience, location, technology stack, and company size. Here’s how these factors contribute to salary differences:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>1. Experience:</strong> Experience is a major determinant of salary. Entry-level developers, those with less than a year of experience, generally earn lower salaries as they are still gaining practical skills and understanding of both front-end and back-end development. As developers gain experience, their salaries tend to rise because of their increased ability to handle complex projects and contribute more effectively to development teams.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2. Technology Stack:</strong> The technology stack a Fullstack developer is proficient in can significantly impact their salary. Developers skilled in popular and high-demand stacks, such as MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) or LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), often command higher salaries. Expertise in modern and diverse technologies is highly valued and can lead to better compensation.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3. Company Size:</strong> The size of the employer affects salary ranges. Larger companies or high-growth startups often offer more competitive salaries and benefits compared to smaller firms or companies outside the tech sector. Companies that are investing heavily in technology and innovation tend to provide higher compensation packages.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>4. Geographic Location:</strong> Location has a significant impact on salary levels. Fullstack developers working in major tech hubs such as San Francisco, New York, or Seattle typically earn higher salaries compared to those in less tech-focused areas. This discrepancy is often due to the higher cost of living in these regions and the competitive job market.
            <br /><br />
            Here’s a breakdown of typical salary ranges for Fullstack developers based on years of experience:
