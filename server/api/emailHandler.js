 * Nodemailer Transporter Configuration
 * 
 * This code sets up a Nodemailer transporter using Gmail as the email service. 
 * Nodemailer is a module for Node.js applications to allow email sending.
 * 
 * - The transporter is configured with the Gmail service.
 * - It uses authentication details provided via environment variables.
 * - `process.env.GMAIL` contains the email address used for sending emails.
 * - `process.env.GMAIL_PASSWORD` contains the password or application-specific password for the Gmail account.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * The transporter can be used to send emails from the configured Gmail account.
 * Ensure that the environment variables `GMAIL` and `GMAIL_PASSWORD` are set correctly in your environment.
